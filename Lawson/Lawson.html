	<p style="font-size:20px"> There once was a girl who wanted to cheer. She used to sit on the stands and all she would hear, was "Let's Go!" and "Fight!" When she got to college she finally decided that she would take action. She went to the tryouts and tried her hardest. A few days later she found out that she had made the team. She was so excited! </P>
